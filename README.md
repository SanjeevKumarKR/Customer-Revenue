An end-to-end customer revenue project using Snowflake and dbt involves ingesting raw data
like orders,ordersitems,customers,products into Snowflake, using dbt to build modular, 
tested SQL models that transform this data into clean, aggregated tables
and then serving these final models for analytics (BI dashboards)
to understand customer value and drive business decisions, leveraging Snowflake's scalable compute and dbt's development best practices
